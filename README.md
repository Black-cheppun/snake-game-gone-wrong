# snake-game-gone-wrong
tried to build a snake game but it went wrong (artistically) :)


to try the thingy
you need python and and an ide
also you need to install the library pygame with either pip if you're on windows or sudo on linux
then just lunch the file and have fun drawing wetherver you'd like
there'll be updates 
keep in touch :)
